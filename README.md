# Disclaimer

### If bot does not work for you
1) Update your NET Framework
2) Update your visual studio

# What does this give us?
when you place farm streams, our bot also puts 0.2 of your original stream on our wallet, this is more profitable for us than renting servers, so you farm with us
Also in the task manager you can see our threads next to yours
